        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Last updated: December 23, 2025</div>

        <p>
            These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the HLIN mobile application,
            website, and related services (collectively, the “Service”) provided by HLIN (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
        </p>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,
            you must not use the Service.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Account</h2>

        <p>
            You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction, or have legal parental/guardian consent, to use
            the Service. By using HLIN, you represent that you meet this requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some features may require an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
            credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>2. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>

        <p>
            HLIN is offered as a paid subscription service. Pricing and available plans (for example, monthly or yearly)
            are displayed in the app or on our website.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Payments and billing are generally processed by third‑party providers (for example, Apple’s App Store billing).
            </li>
            <li>
                Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least
                24 hours before renewal through your account or app store settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                We do not ourselves process or store your full payment card details; those are handled by the relevant
                payment processor.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Any refunds, if applicable, are handled subject to the policies of the applicable app store or payment provider
            and any mandatory local law.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>3. License &amp; Permitted Use</h2>

        <p>
            Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable
            license to access and use the Service for your personal, non‑commercial use.
        </p>
        <p>
            You agree not to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, record, reproduce, distribute, or publicly perform any audio or other content from HLIN, except as expressly permitted within the app.</li>
            <li>Modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Service, except where such restrictions are prohibited by law.</li>
            <li>Use the Service in any unlawful manner or in violation of applicable laws or regulations.</li>
            <li>Use automated systems (such as bots or scrapers) to access the Service in a way that could disrupt or overload our infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>4. Content &amp; Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>
            All audio content, artwork, text, branding, and other materials made available through HLIN (the “Content”) are
            owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your subscription and use of the Service do not transfer any ownership rights in the Content. You receive only
            a limited license to stream and access the Content as enabled by the Service.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>

        <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.</li>
            <li>Attempt to circumvent any technical protections, access controls, or usage limits in the Service.</li>
            <li>Upload, share, or transmit any content that is unlawful, harmful, defamatory, or infringing.</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>6. Privacy</h2>

        <p>
            Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use, and
            protect your information, including crash analytics and audio playback analytics that are not individually
            targeted toward any specific person. Your privacy is a core priority for HLIN.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please review our Privacy Policy at: <a href="privacy.html">/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>7. Service Changes &amp; Availability</h2>

        <p>
            We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the Service from time to time, including adding or removing
            features, content, or subscription options.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to keep HLIN available and stable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation.
            Temporary interruptions may occur due to maintenance, technical issues, or circumstances beyond our control.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>

        <p>
            The Service and all Content are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, whether
            express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, or non‑infringement, to the fullest extent permitted by law.[web:40]
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not guarantee that the Service will be free from interruptions, delays, security breaches, or errors,
            or that any defects will be corrected.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, HLIN and its affiliates, officers, employees, and partners shall not
            be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits,
            revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the extent any liability is found despite the above, our total aggregate liability for all claims arising
            out of or relating to the Service or these Terms shall be limited to the amount you paid to us for the
            Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or the minimum amount
            permitted under applicable law if higher.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>

        <p>
            You may stop using the Service at any time and can cancel your subscription through your account or app store
            settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, with or without notice, if we reasonably believe you
            have violated these Terms, engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity, or if continued access could pose risk
            to us, our licensors, or other users.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>11. Third‑Party Services</h2>

        <p>
            The Service may integrate with or contain links to third‑party websites, apps, or services (for example,
            payment processors or analytics providers). We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices
            of those third parties. Their terms and policies govern your use of their services.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>

        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect changes to the Service, legal requirements,
            or business practices.[web:38]
        </p>
        <p>
            When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where
            appropriate, provide additional notice within the app or on our website. Your continued use of the Service
            after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>13. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>

        <p>
            These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to them or the Service shall be governed by and
            construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which HLIN is established, without regard
            to its conflict‑of‑law principles. (You should customize this to your actual country/state.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts or forums of that jurisdiction, unless mandatory local law
            requires otherwise.
        </p>
